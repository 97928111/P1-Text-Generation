# Welcome to the new world

# You can find whatever you want here, treasure, weapon, power or anything else

Welcome, I am the president of this new planet, or I should say I am the first one who gets on this new planet. 
I have given it a name of it and made a small rule that satisfied my young dream. 
Haha, but I am really welcome to any adventures or lost people to enjoy my planet.
Thank you all, thank you!

Question: What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect? If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing? 

I just wants to create a small speech, not even like a speech, just a little 'talk'. 
I think I achieve the effect, it is kind of fun to read it.
